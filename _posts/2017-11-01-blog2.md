 Life has been treating me well, and teaching me lessons  which I appreciate. I love to watch Beetlejuice whenever I get sad, or possibly any Tim Burton Movie. It's like honey watching his creations. My dream since I was like six was to meet Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. I love Tim Burton because he has created so much ideas, especially Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Tim Burton is like a soft spot inside of me. He is my favorite creators and I think he will be forever, especially Beetlejuice (along with the cartoon).
 
 This has also been the week of my friend and our 4 year annerversary. I thought being in a relationship as young as 13, it'll probably last like 5 months probably less. But two years ACTUALLY BEING TOGETHER, and four years knowing eachother, Zoey is not even half that age. It feels good being in a relationship, but eh. It has it's gray parts, just like with every relationship. Tolerence is key. And I don't like puppy love or "public love"; it took him a while to realize that there's always a time and a place. He is not my 'boyfriend', he's one of my best friends! And I'm really grateful for the blissful memories we have together and I'm hoping for so much more!
